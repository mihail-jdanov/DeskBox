# DeskBox
Simple GUI app for [sing-box](https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box) management.

## Platforms
Only Windows for now. On Apple devices you can use [original sing-box client](https://sing-box.sagernet.org/clients/apple/)

## Installation
Extract the archive (for example, to the Program Files folder) and run DeskBox.exe. You can also replace sing-box.exe in the application folder with the [version](https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box/releases) you need.

Please note that the application **requires administrator privileges to run**.
